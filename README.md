# rohm
React + Option Heuristics Manger => Rohm.

The new goal of Rohm is to build a Stock/Option heuristics engine using several well known option screener techniques:
* Covered Calls
* Iron Condors
* Put/Call Spreads


Rohm was previously a project designed to use Redis + Ohm to implement facet filtering. The project has since pivoted into a project for me to learn React.js with Ruby on Rails.


The goal of rohm is to provide a fast and open interface to introduce you to option trading systems.
